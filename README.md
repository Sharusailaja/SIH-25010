## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
The solution is a Smart Crop Advisory Platform accessible via mobile app, chatbot, and voice support. It integrates soil data, weather forecasts, market trends, and pest detection models to provide personalized recommendations. The app will be multilingual and user-friendly, ensuring accessibility even for digitally less-experienced farmers.
## Technical Approach
Technologies:

Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript

Frameworks: Django/Flask for backend, React Native/Flutter for mobile app

AI/ML: TensorFlow/PyTorch for pest detection and predictive models

Cloud: AWS/Azure/Google Cloud for scalability

Databases: PostgreSQL/MongoDB for structured and unstructured data

APIs: Weather, soil health databases, market price feeds

Methodology / Implementation:

Data collection (soil health, weather APIs, crop history).

AI models for pest detection and yield prediction.

Mobile app/chatbot development with multilingual and voice support.

Integration of market price tracking modules.

Pilot testing with farmers and iterative improvement
## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility: Mobile penetration in rural India is high; AI and cloud tools are mature enough to support real-time advisory.

Challenges: Internet connectivity gaps, digital literacy, and trust-building with farmers.

Mitigation Strategies:

Offline-first app design with SMS/IVR backup.

Voice assistance in native languages.

Partnerships with local NGOs and government for farmer training.
## Impact and Benefits
Social: Improves farmer confidence, reduces reliance on middlemen.

Economic: Higher crop yields, reduced input costs, better market prices.

Environmental: Sustainable farming through reduced chemical use and improved soil health.
## Research and References
NABARD Report (2022): 86% of Indian farmers are small/marginal.

FAO Studies: ICT advisories can increase yields by 20–30%.
